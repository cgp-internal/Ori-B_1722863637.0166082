# Data Storage Solution README

## Project Overview

This project provides a data storage solution using a CSV file to store Car records. The solution consists of a main entry point (app.js), a CSV parser (data/csv-parser.js), a Car model (models/car.js), and a CSV file for data storage (data/data.csv).

## Installation and Setup

To set up the project, run the following script:

```
bash run.sh
```

This script will install Node, initialize a new project, and install the required packages.

## Usage Guide

To use the data storage solution, follow these steps:

1. Initialize the storage by calling the `initStorage` function in app.js.
2. Read data from the storage by calling the `readStorage` function in app.js.
3. Write data to the storage by calling the `writeStorage` function in app.js.

## API Endpoints

The solution exposes the following API endpoints:

* `initStorage`: Initializes the data storage.
* `readStorage`: Reads data from the storage.
* `writeStorage`: Writes data to the storage.

## Configuration

The CSV file (data/data.csv) is initialized with three sample Car records. You can modify this file to add or update records.

## Dependencies

The solution depends on the following files:

* data/csv-parser.js
* models/car.js

These files provide functions for reading and writing data to and from the CSV file, and represent the Car entity, respectively.
